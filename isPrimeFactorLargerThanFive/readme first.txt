................Challenge....................

There are a positive number which has no prime factor larger than 5

So the first few numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10

Write a function which takes a positive number as input and,
returns true if it has no prime factor larger than 5


...............Thinking process...............

This is not the exact solution, but do you know how to find the least common multiple (LCM) ???

(Understanding the behavior of the prime number when we find the LCM, you can solve this challenge quickly.) 

Finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers involves identifying the smallest multiple that all of these numbers can evenly divide into. Here are the steps to find the LCM of two or more numbers:

Step 1: Prime Factorization

Begin by finding the prime factorization of the number. 
Prime factorization involves breaking down each number into its prime factors.

You can also follow these steps for finding the LCM of more than two numbers. 
Find the prime factorization for each number, identify common and unique prime factors, and then calculate the LCM using the common and unique prime factors.
